# Comparison of Simulated Layers between CloudSim and MS-Sim 

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwallschlaeger/MS-Sim/master/docs/compare_CloudSim-MS_Sim.png)
CloudSim is a Simulation environment for all cloud layers and allows to define every component individually, in which on the other side MS-Sim only simulates the application running inside a container or in a virtual machine. 
Simulations are always simplified representations of the reality and never consider and simulate all aspects of the real world. Simulation always only consider features which the authors think are useful for their purpose. As anomalies are diverse and can occur in any layer and be of any kind using a general simulation on all layers reduces the possibilities to only the features CloudSim does provide.
